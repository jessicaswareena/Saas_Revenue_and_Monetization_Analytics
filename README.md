# Revenue & Monetization Analytics – NimbusFlow (SaaS)
### Understanding the Challenge
A subscription-based SaaS company, **NimbusFlow**, began to notice something alarming: even though new customers kept signing up and people were using the product, **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** started to **decline.**

At first glance, leadership wasn’t sure why. Was the business losing customers faster than it could gain them? Were existing clients downgrading their plans? Or was there something fundamentally wrong with how revenue was being generated and retained?

As the data analyst supporting Finance, Product, and Growth, the goal was clear — **move beyond surface-level revenue reporting** and uncover the true drivers behind revenue changes over time.

### Project Overview
• Industry: B2B SaaS – Workflow & Collaboration Software

• Customers: About **6,500 active business users**

• Pricing Model: Subscription with **Free, Basic, Pro, and Enterprise tiers**

•Regions: North America & Europe

Data Period: **Jan 2024 – Jun 2025** (18 months)

Despite having a steady stream of new customers, the company entered 2025 with **volatile MRR** and leadership lacked visibility into:

• How much revenue was lost each month to **churn** (customer cancellations).

• Whether current customers were expanding or shrinking their usage.

• Whether growth could continue **without spending more on acquisition.**

This analysis aimed to answer those questions with data, clarity, and context.
### Key Insights & Analysis Focus area
To get to the heart of the issue, the analysis focused on four central questions:

1. MRR Performance: How has recurring revenue actually changed over time?

2. Revenue Drivers: Which forces — new customers, upgrades, downgrades, or churn — are moving the revenue number?

3. Revenue Mix: Which subscription tiers bring in most of the revenue, and how risky is that concentration?

4. Retention Quality: Can NimbusFlow realistically grow from existing customers, or is it dependent on constant acquisition?
### Data Structure
The dataset simulated a real SaaS environment using these key tables:

This structure allowed analysis without distortion from partial months and ensured each MRR or retention figure accurately reflected real performance.
### Overview of Findings

**Revenue Performance Overview**

• MRR **peaked in late 2024** but steadily declined afterward.

• Revenue was heavily **concentrated in the Pro tier**, exposing the business to higher churn risk.

• Core health signals:

Net Revenue Retention (NRR): 74%

Gross Revenue Retention (GRR): 62%

MRR Churn: 16%

These numbers confirmed that **retention, not acquisition, was the weak link.**

**MRR Change Drivers**

• Every month, **Churned MRR outweighed New and Expansion MRR.**

• Revenue losses weren’t random; they formed a **8consistent negative trend.**

• The insight: sustaining growth wasn’t the problem — **keeping revenue was.**

**Retention & Revenue Sustainability**

• **NRR below 100%** means that existing customers weren’t fueling growth.

• **GRR decline** reinforced that too much revenue was slipping away before any upsell effects could materialize.

• Result: highly **unstable and unpredictable** monthly revenue performance.

### Insights Deep Dive
**MRR Trend & Momentum**

NimbusFlow’s MRR grew steadily through most of 2024. But entering 2025, that upward curve flattened and began turning downward. Churn rose sharply — the first sign that what was broken wasn’t sales, but **retention.**

**Revenue Driver Breakdown**

When the team mapped every gain and loss month over month:

• **New and expansion revenue helped**, but

• **Churn consistently erased those gains,** leading to overall **negative net MRR growth.**

This made the core issue clear: **revenue leakage** dominated.

**Retention Health**

With **NRR below 100%,** the company had to work harder just to stay even. Each month, new sales filled the bucket — but that same bucket had several holes in it.

### Conclusions

After untangling the drivers behind MRR, the findings were unambiguous:

• The company doesn’t have an acquisition problem — acquiring customers isn’t the challenge.

• The main revenue threat comes from churn and plan downgrades.

• Growth is unsustainable without fixing churn first.

• Improving retention offers the highest ROI compared to simply pushing for more new customers.

### Executive Highlights
• **MRR decline** is rooted in **customer churn,** not lack of new sales.

• **Churned revenue** consistently exceeds new and expansion gains.

• Over **60%** of revenue resides in the **Pro plan,** heightening exposure risk.

• **NRR below 100%** highlights **unsustainable growth** patterns.

• The **fastest way to stabilize** revenue is to focus on **retention improvements.**

### Recommendations
**1. Tackle Churn Head-On**

• Investigate churn causes by **plan type and customer segment.**

• Improve onboarding, activation milestones, and ongoing value delivery.

• Strengthen communication during the first few months of usage — the most vulnerable period.

**2. Drive Expansion Opportunities**

• Make **upgrade paths** clearer and more rewarding.

• Use **usage-based signals** to identify high-engagement clients ripe for upsell.

**3. Reduce Revenue Concentration Risk**

• Rebalance growth by increasing **Basic-tier conversions** and **Enterprise adoption.**

• Decrease reliance on a single plan (currently Pro) as the primary revenue source.

**4. Hold Off on Aggressive Acquisition**

• Plug the leaks first. Fixing **retention** will multiply the benefit of any new growth campaign afterward.

### What I'do next with more data
If more data were available, the next steps would involve:

• **Cohort analysis** to see how churn changes with customer age.

• Calculating **LTV/CAC** (customer lifetime value vs. acquisition cost) for better ROI forecasting.

• Merging product usage analytics to identify **early churn signals.**

• Modeling **MRR impact scenarios** — for example, a **+5% GRR improvement** over six months.

• Running **A/B retention experiments** to measure what actually moves the needle.

### Data foundation & assumptions

• Analysis done at **monthly granularity** using completed months only.

• Revenue defined strictly as **recurring subscription income (MRR).**

• **Churn** includes both cancellations and non-renewals.

• No multi-product bundles — every record represents one subscription per customer.

•  Results are valid for the Jan 2024 – Jun 2025 window and can be re-run as data updates.
